        Intro to HTML and CSS was our first project. The code was downloaded into our editor, and we were
        responsible for finding the syntax errors that broke the website. At first, this one task sounded simple enough, but it was very daunting
        and overwhelming to say the least. I felt like I was left out in the ocean to swim my way back home. With all
        these feels running through me, I was able to find focus and start taking baby steps by solving one syntax error
        at a time. Surprisingly, I was able to success far beyond I believed, and I was able to view a beautiful website.
