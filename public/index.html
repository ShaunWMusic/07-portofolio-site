              Intro to HTML and CSS was our first project. The code was downloaded into our editor, and we were
              responsible for finding the syntax errors that broke the website. At first, this one task sounded simple enough, but it was very daunting
              and overwhelming to say the least. I felt like I was left out in the ocean to swim my way back home. With all
              these feels running through me, I was able to find focus and start taking baby steps by solving one syntax error
              at a time. Surprisingly, I was able to success far beyond I believed, and I was able to view a beautiful website.

              Surf & paddling blog was a webpage that we built on day 4. This exercise taught me too many things to list, but
              I can touch on the most important one. I learned how to use flexbox and all its properties. I also learned
              how to group div containers to respond appropriate to its' child elements.

              During Week 2 - Day 2, We built a webpage that was based off this concept that once the mouse hovered
              of an element, that element would change. A list of options would appear for the user to choose which
              color tshirt, and what size tshirt that they would like to order. The layout would change depending on
              where or not the user was on an ipad. To change the layout, we also learned how to used media query.
